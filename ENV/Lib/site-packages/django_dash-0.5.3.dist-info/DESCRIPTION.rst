django-dash
===========
``django-dash`` (later on named Dash) is a customisable, modular dashboard
application framework for Django.

Dash allows users to create their own custom dashboards. Supports theeming (in
Dash themes are called layouts) and multiple workspaces. Dash comes with
extensive pythonic API which allows developers to create new Dash plugins, as
well as to modify bundled ones.

To make a clearer association, think of Android for tablets (shortcuts, widgets
and apps) or Windows 8 for tablets or desktops.

Dash inherits all those concepts and makes it possible to implement a dashboard
system for Django applications with minimal efforts.

Prerequisites
=============
Present
-------
- Django 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11
- Python >=2.7, >=3.4

Past
----
- Dropping support of Django 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7 has been announced in version
  0.5. As of 0.5 everything is still backwards compatible with above mentioned
  versions , but in future versions compatibility with these versions will be
  wiped out.
- Support of Python 2.6 has been dropped in version 0.5.

Key concepts
============
- Each layout (theme) consist of placeholders. Each plugin widget has its' own
  specific HTML/JavaScript/CSS.
- There might be multiple themes implemented and installed. Default layout is 
  chosen system wide, but each user (if has an appropriate permission) can
  choose his preferred layout over all workspaces or even different layouts 
  per workspace.
- Placeholder is a space, in which the plugin widgets are placed.
- Placeholders are rectangles consisting of cells. Each placeholder has its' 
  own custom number of rows and columns.
- Workspace is just another named dashboard. Users switch between workspaces 
  in navigation. Amount of workspaces is unlimited.
- Plugin is a (Django) micro app. Most heavy work should happen in plugin. 
  Plugin may have its' own views, urls, etc. Rendering happens with use of
  plugin widgets.
- Plugin widgets are mainly responsible for rendering of the plugin data. 
  Each plugin widget has its' own specific HTML/JavaScript/CSS. A single
  plugin widget is registered for a triple (layout, placeholder, plugin).
- Public dashboard (implemented as a contrib app, which makes it optional)
  allows users to make their workspaces public. If user chooses to make his
  dashboard public, default workspace becomes public. As for non-default
  workspaces, user can still make each of them private or public.

Main features
=============
- Customisable layouts (aka theeming).
- Multiple workspaces.
- Tunable access permissions to plugins.
- Public dashboards (as a contrib app).
- Cloneable workspaces. It's possible to clone entire workspace, including
  all the plugins into another workspace.
- Copy/paste functionality for plugin widgets.

FAQ
===
- Question: Is it possible to have Dash working with a (pick what's applicable: 
  D3, Polychart2, or some other library for making charts).

  Answer: Yes. Check the source code of the following sample plugins:

    - `Sample D3 plugins
      <https://github.com/barseghyanartur/django-dash/tree/master/examples/example/d3_samples>`_.
    - `Sample Polychart2 plugin
      <https://github.com/barseghyanartur/django-dash/tree/master/examples/example/bar>`_.

- `ReadTheDocs <http://django-dash.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#screenshots>`_

Demo
====
Live demo
---------
See the `live demo app <https://django-dash.herokuapp.com/>`_ on Heroku.

Credentials:

- username: test_user
- password: test_user

See the public dashboard of a `test_demo_user
<https://django-dash.herokuapp.com/en/test_demo_user/>`_ to get an idea of what
it could become.

Run demo locally
----------------
In order to be able to quickly evaluate the `django-dash`, a demo app (with a
quick installer) has been created (works on Ubuntu/Debian, may work on other
Linux systems as well, although not guaranteed). Follow the instructions
below for having the demo running within a minute.

Grab the latest ``django_dash_example_app_installer.sh``:

.. code-block:: sh

    wget https://raw.github.com/barseghyanartur/django-dash/stable/examples/django_dash_example_app_installer.sh

Assign execute rights to the installer and run the
``django_dash_example_app_installer.sh``:

.. code-block:: sh

    chmod +x django_dash_example_app_installer.sh

    ./django_dash_example_app_installer.sh

Open your browser and test the app.

Dashboard:

- URL: http://127.0.0.1:8001/dashboard/
- Admin username: test_admin
- Admin password: test

Django admin interface:

- URL: http://127.0.0.1:8001/administration/
- Admin username: test_admin
- Admin password: test

If quick installer doesn't work for you, see the manual steps on running the
`example project
<https://github.com/barseghyanartur/django-dash/tree/stable/examples>`__.

Take a look at the templates in "example/example/templates" directory for
getting a better idea of how to transform your own or third-party templates
into Dash templates.

Also, the `example project
<https://github.com/barseghyanartur/django-dash/tree/stable/examples/example/foo>`__
has example layouts, plugins and widgets implemented. Take it as a good example
of how to add widgets for existing plugins to your own custom layout.
Make sure to see how same is done for the `bundled layouts
<https://github.com/barseghyanartur/django-dash/tree/stable/src/dash/contrib/layouts/>`_.

Installation
============
1. Install latest stable version from PyPI:

    .. code-block:: sh

        pip install django-dash

    Or latest stable version from GitHub:

    .. code-block:: sh

        pip install https://github.com/barseghyanartur/django-dash/archive/stable.tar.gz

    Or latest stable version from BitBucket:

    .. code-block:: sh

        pip install https://bitbucket.org/barseghyanartur/django-dash/get/stable.tar.gz

2. Add `dash` to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` of the your projects' Django settings.
   Furthermore, all layouts and plugins to be used, shall be added to the
   ``INSTALLED_APPS`` as well.

    .. code-block:: python

        INSTALLED_APPS = (
            # ...
            'dash',
            'dash.contrib.layouts.android',
            'dash.contrib.layouts.bootstrap2',
            'dash.contrib.layouts.windows8',
            'dash.contrib.plugins.dummy',
            'dash.contrib.plugins.image',
            'dash.contrib.plugins.memo',
            'dash.contrib.plugins.rss_feed',
            'dash.contrib.plugins.url',
            'dash.contrib.plugins.video',
            'dash.contrib.plugins.weather',
            # ...
        )

3. Make sure that ``django.core.context_processors.request`` is in
   ``TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS``.

4. Add necessary URL patterns to your ``urls`` module.

   .. code-block:: python

       url(r'^dashboard/', include('dash.urls')),

   Additionally, add all URLs of any Dash apps or plugins

   .. code-block:: python

       # django-dash RSS contrib plugin URLs:
       url(r'^dash/contrib/plugins/rss-feed/',
           include('dash.contrib.plugins.rss_feed.urls')),

       # django-dash public dashboards contrib app:
       url(r'^', include('dash.contrib.apps.public_dashboard.urls')),

Creating a new layout
=====================
Dash comes with several bundled layouts. Do check their source code as example. 

Let's say, our imaginary layout has two placeholders. One large placeholder for
all kinds of widgets (called ``main``) and a tiny one for shortcuts (called
``shortcuts``).

Placeholder ``main``:

- Single cell size  :  150 x 110 pixels
- Dimensions        :  6 cols, 5 rows

Placeholder ``shortcuts``:

- Single cell size  :  60 x 55 pixels
- Dimensions        :  1 cols, 10 rows

See the figure below to get an idea of what placeholders are:

- Placeholder ``main`` consts of cells from 11 to 56.
- Placeholder ``shortcuts`` consists of cells from 1 to 10.

A single plugin widget may occupy one or more cells. Plugin widgets are
rectangles.

To make it clear, see following cases:

- Plugin widget has 2 cols and 1 row. Then, for example, it may occupy cells
  (11 and 12).
- Plugin widget has 2 cols and 2 rows. Then, for example, it may occupy cells 
  (11, 12, 21 and 22).
- Plugin widget has 1 col and 3 rows. Then, for example, it may occupy cells 
  (11, 21 and 31).
- Plugin widget has 4 cols and 3 rows. Then, for example, it may occupy cells 
  (22, 23, 24, 25, 32, 33, 34, 35, 42, 43, 44 and 45).

There are some rules/guidelines you should follow.

Let's assume that layout is named ``example``. The layout directory should then
have the following structure.

.. code-block:: text

    path/to/layout/example/
    ├── static
    │   ├── css
    │   │   └── dash_layout_example.css # Contains layout-specific CSS
    │   ├── images
    │   └── js
    │       └── dash_layout_example.js # Contains layout specific JavaScripts
    ├── templates
    │   └── example
    │       ├── edit_layout.html # Master edit layout
    │       └── view_layout.html # Master view layout
    ├── __init__.py

    ├── dash_plugins.py # Where layout specific plugins and plugin widgets are defined and registered
    └── dash_widgets.py # Where layout specific plugin widgets are defined

Layout and placeholder classes should be placed in the ``dash_layouts.py``
file.

Each layout should be put into the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` of your Django projects'
``settings.py`` module.

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        # ...
        'path.to.layout.example',
        # ...
    )

path/to/layout/example/dash_layouts.py
--------------------------------------
Step by step review of a how to create and register a layout and placeholders.
Note, that Dash auto-discovers your layouts by name of the file
``dash_layouts.py``. The module, in which the layouts are defined, has to be
named ``dash_layouts.py``.

Required imports.

.. code-block:: python

    from dash.base import BaseDashboardLayout, BaseDashboardPlaceholder
    from dash.base import layout_registry

Defining the Main placeholder.

.. code-block:: python

    class ExampleMainPlaceholder(BaseDashboardPlaceholder):

        uid = 'main'  # Unique ID of the placeholder.
        cols = 6  # Number of columns in the placeholder.
        rows = 5  # Number of rows in the placeholder.
        cell_width = 150  # Width of a single cell in the placeholder.
        cell_height = 110  # Height of a single cell in the placeholder.

Defining the Shortcuts placeholder.

.. code-block:: python

    class ExampleShortcutsPlaceholder(BaseDashboardPlaceholder):

        uid = 'shortcuts'  # UID of the placeholder.
        cols = 1  # Number of columns in the placeholder.
        rows = 10  # Number of rows in the placeholder.
        cell_width = 60  # Width of a single cell in the placeholder.
        cell_height = 55  # Height of a single cell in the placeholder.

Defining and registering the Layout.

.. code-block:: python

    class ExampleLayout(BaseDashboardLayout):

        uid = 'example'  # Layout UID.
        name = 'Example'  # Layout name.

        # View template. Master template used in view mode.
        view_template_name = 'example/view_layout.html'

        # Edit template. Master template used in edit mode.
        edit_template_name = 'example/edit_layout.html'

        # All placeholders listed. Note, that placeholders are rendered in the
        # order specified here.
        placeholders = [ExampleMainPlaceholder, ExampleShortcutsPlaceholder]

        # Cell units used in the entire layout. Allowed values are: 'px',
        # 'pt', 'em' or '%'. In the ``ExampleMainPlaceholder`` cell_width is
        # set to 150. It means that in this particular case its' actual width
        # would be `150px`.
        cell_units = 'px'

        # Layout specific CSS.
        media_css = ('css/dash_layout_example.css',)

        # Layout specific JS.
        media_js = ('js/dash_layout_example.js',)

    # Registering the layout.
    layout_registry.register(ExampleLayout)

HTML templates
--------------
You custom layout should be inherited from base layout templates (view or
edit). Both view and edit layouts share a lot of things, still edit layout is
a bit more "heavy".

- view_layout.html should inherit from "dash/layouts/base_view_layout.html".
- edit_layout.html should inherit from "dash/layouts/base_edit_layout.html".

Both "dash/layouts/base_view_layout.html" and
"dash/layouts/base_edit_layout.html" inherit from
"dash/layouts/base_layout.html", which in its' turn inherits from
"dash/base.html".

Note, that when rendered to HTML, each Dash template, gets a body class
"layout" + layouts' unique identifier (UID). So, the ``ExampleLayout``
layout would automatically get the class "layout-example".

.. code-block:: html

    <body class="layout-example">

In case of Android layout (UID "android") it would be as follows.

.. code-block:: html

    <body class="layout-android">

Base your layout specific custom CSS on presence of those classes.

Same goes for Placeholders. Each placeholder gets ``id_`` + placeholders' UID
and the classes "placeholder" and "placeholder-" + placeholders' UID. So, the
``ExampleMainPlaceholder`` would look as follows.

.. code-block:: html

    <div id="id_main" class="placeholder placeholder-main">

And the ``ExampleShortcutsPlaceholder`` placeholder would look as follows.

.. code-block:: html

    <div id="id_shortcuts" class="placeholder placeholder-shortcuts">

Same goes for plugin widgets. Apart from some other classes that each plugin
widget would get for positioning, it gets the "plugin" and "plugin-" + plugin
UID. See the following example (for the plugin Dummy with UID "dummy"). Each
plugin also gets an automatic UID on the moment when rendered. In the example
below it's the "p6d06f17d-e142-4f45-b9c1-893c38fc2b01".

.. code-block:: html

    <div id="p6d06f17d-e142-4f45-b9c1-893c38fc2b01" class="plugin plugin-dummy">

Layout, placeholder, plugin and plugin widget have properties for getting their
HTML specific classes and IDs.

Layout (instance)

.. code-block:: python

    layout.html_class

Placeholder (instance)

.. code-block:: python

    placeholder.html_id
    placeholder.html_class

Plugin (instance)

.. code-block:: python

    plugin.html_id
    plugin.html_class

Plugin widget (static call)

.. code-block:: python

    plugin_widget.html_class  # Static one

Creating a new plugin
=====================
Dash comes with several bundled plugins. Do check their source code as example.

Making of a plugin or a plugin widget is quite simple, although there are some
rules/guidelines you should follow.

Let's assume that plugin is named ``sample_memo``. The plugin directory should
then have the following structure.

Note, that you are advised to prefix all your plugin specific media files
with ``dash_plugin_`` for the sake of common sense.

.. code-block:: text

    path/to/plugin/sample_memo/
    ├── static
    │   ├── css
    │   │   └── dash_plugin_sample_memo.css # Plugin specific CSS
    │   ├── images
    │   └── js
    │       └── dash_plugin_sample_memo.js # Plugin specific JavaScripts
    ├── templates
    │   └── sample_memo
    │       ├── render_main.html # Plugin widget template for ``main`` Placeholder
    │       └── render_short.html # Plugin widget template for ``shortcuts`` Placeholder
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── dash_plugins.py # Where plugins and widgets are defined and registered
    ├── dash_widgets.py # Where the plugin widgets are defined
    └── forms.py # Plugin configuration form

In some cases, you would need plugin specific overridable settings (see
``dash.contrib.plugins.weather`` plugin as an example. You are advised to
write your settings in such a way, that variables of your Django projects'
``settings.py`` module would have ``DASH_PLUGIN_`` prefix.

path/to/plugin/sample_memo/dash_plugins.py
------------------------------------------
Step by step review of a how to create and register a plugin and plugin
widgets. Note, that Dash auto-discovers your plugins if you place them into a
file named ``dash_plugins.py`` of any Django app listed in ``INSTALLED_APPS``
of your Django projects' settings module.

Define and register the plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As already stated, a single plugin widget is registered for a triple (layout,
placeholder, plugin). That means, that if you need two widgets, one sized 1x1
and another sized 2x2, you need two plugins for it. You can either manually
define all plugins and widgets for the sizes desired, or define a single
base plugin or a widget class and have it factory registered for a number of
given sizes. Below, both approaches would be explained.

Required imports.

.. code-block:: python

    from dash.base import BaseDashboardPlugin, plugin_registry
    from path.to.plugin.sample_memo.forms import SampleMemoForm

Defining the Sample Memo plugin (2x2) (to be used in the ``main`` placeholder).

.. code-block:: python

    class SampleMemo2x2Plugin(BaseDashboardPlugin):

        uid = 'sample_memo_2x2'  # Plugin UID
        name = _("Memo")  # Plugin name
        group = _("Memo")  # Group to which the plugin belongs to
        form = SampleMemoForm  # Plugin forms are explained later
        html_classes = ['sample-memo']  # Optional. Adds extra HTML classes.

Registering the Sample Memo plugin.

.. code-block:: python

    plugin_registry.register(SampleMemo2x2Plugin)

Defining the Sample Memo plugin (1x1) (to be used in the ``shortcuts``
placeholder).

.. code-block:: python

    class SampleMemo1x1Plugin(SampleMemo2x2Plugin):

        uid = 'sample_memo_1x1'  # Plugin UID

Registering the Sample Memo plugin.

.. code-block:: python

    plugin_registry.register(SampleMemo1x1Plugin)

Repeat the steps below for each plugin size (or read about factory registering
the plugins and widgets below).

Factory register plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Alternatively, you can define just a single plugin base class and have it
factory registered for the given sizes. The code below would produce and
register classes for in sizes 1x1 and 2x2. When you need to register a plugin
for 10 sizes, this approach clearly wins. Besides, it's very easy to get a
clear overview of all plugins sizes registered.

Required imports.

.. code-block:: python

    from dash.base import BaseDashboardPlugin
    from dash.factory import plugin_factory
    from path.to.plugin.sample_memo.forms import SampleMemoForm

Defining the base plugin class.

.. code-block:: python

    class BaseSampleMemoPlugin(BaseDashboardPlugin):

        name = _("Memo")  # Plugin name
        group = _("Memo")  # Group to which the plugin belongs to
        form = SampleMemoForm  # Plugin forms are explained later
        html_classes = ['sample-memo']  # Optional. Adds extra HTML classes.

Note, that we don't provide ``uid`` property in the base class.

Now, that we have the base plugin defined, factory register it for the sizes
given.

.. code-block:: python

    sizes = (
        (1, 1),
        (2, 2),
    )
    plugin_factory(BaseSampleMemoPlugin, 'sample_memo', sizes)

In the example above, "sample_memo" is the base name of the plugin. Size
information would be appended to it ("sample_memo_1x1", "sample_memo_2x2").

Register plugin widgets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Plugin widgets are defined in ``dash_widgets.py`` module (described later), but
registered in the ``dash_plugins.py``, which is auto-discovered by Dash.

Required imports.

.. code-block:: python

    from dash.base import plugin_widget_registry
    from path.to.plugin.sample_memo.dash_widgets import (
        SampleMemo1x1ExampleMainWidget,
        SampleMemo2x2ExampleMainWidget
    )

Registering the Sample Memo plugin widget for placeholder ``main`` of layout
`example``.

.. code-block:: python

    plugin_widget_registry.register(SampleMemo2x2ExampleMainWidget)

Registering the Sample Memo plugin widget for placeholder ``shortcuts`` of
layout ``example``.

.. code-block:: python

    plugin_widget_registry.register(SampleMemo1x1ExampleMainWidget)

path/to/plugin/sample_memo/dash_widgets.py
------------------------------------------
Why to have another file for defining widgets? Just to keep the code clean and
less messy, although you could perfectly define all your plugin widgets in the
module ``dash_plugins.py``, it's recommended to keep it separate.

Take into consideration, that ``dash_widgets.py`` is not an auto-discovered
file pattern. All your plugin widgets should be registered in modules named
``dash_plugins.py``.

Define and register the plugin widget
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Required imports.

.. code-block:: python

    from django.template.loader import render_to_string
    from dash.base import BaseDashboardPluginWidget

Memo plugin widget for Example layout (placeholder ``main``).

.. code-block:: python

    class SampleMemo2x2ExampleMainWidget(BaseDashboardPluginWidget):

        layout_uid = 'example'  # Layout for which the widget is written
        placeholder_uid = 'main'  # Placeholder within the layout for which
                                  # the widget is written
        plugin_uid = 'sample_memo_2x2'  # Plugin for which the widget is
                                        # written
        cols = 2  # Number of widget columns
        rows = 2  # Number of widget rows

        def render(self, request=None):
            context = {'plugin': self.plugin}
            return render_to_string('sample_memo/render_main.html', context)

Memo plugin widget for Example layout (placeholder `shortcuts`).

.. code-block:: python

    class SampleMemo1x1ExampleShortcutWidget(SampleMemo2x2ExampleMainWidget):

        placeholder_uid = 'shortcuts'  # Placeholder within the layout for
                                       # which the widget is written
        cols = 1  # Number of widget columns
        rows = 1  # Number of widget rows

        def render(self, request=None):
            context = {'plugin': self.plugin}
            return render_to_string(
                'sample_memo/render_shortcuts.html', context
            )

Factory register plugin widgets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Alternatively, you can define just a single plugin widget base class and have
it factory registered for the given sizes. The code below would produce and
register classes for in sizes 1x1 and 2x2.

Required imports.

.. code-block:: python

    from django.template.loader import render_to_string
    from dash.factory import plugin_widget_factory
    from dash.base import BaseDashboardPluginWidget

Defining the base plugin widget class.

.. code-block:: python

    class BaseSampleMemoWidget(BaseDashboardPluginWidget):

        def render(self, request=None):
            context = {'plugin': self.plugin}
            return render_to_string('sample_memo/render.html', context)

Now, that we have the base plugin defined, factory register it for the sizes
given.

.. code-block:: python

    sizes = (
        (1, 1),
        (2, 2),
    )
    plugin_widget_factory(
        BaseSampleMemoWidget, 'example', 'main', 'sample_memo', sizes
    )

In the example above:

- "sample_memo" is the base name of the plugin and it should match the name
  given to plugin factory exactly.
- "example" is the uid of the layout, for which the widget is being registered.
- "main" is the uid of the placeholder, for which the widget it being
  registered.

path/to/plugin/sample_memo/forms.py
-----------------------------------
What are the plugin forms? Very simple - if plugin is configurable, it has a
form. If you need to have a custom CSS or a JavaScript included when rendering
a specific form, use Django's class Media directive in the form.

Required imports.

.. code-block:: python

    from django import forms
    from dash.base import DashboardPluginFormBase

Memo form (for `Sample Memo` plugin).

.. code-block:: python

    class SampleMemoForm(forms.Form, DashboardPluginFormBase):

        plugin_data_fields = [
            ("title", ""),
            ("text", "")
        ]

        title = forms.CharField(label=_("Title"), required=False)
        text = forms.CharField(label=_("Text"), required=True,
                               widget=forms.widgets.Textarea)

        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            super(MemoForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

Now, that everything is ready, make sure your that both layout and the plugin
modules are added to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` for your projects' Django ``settings.py``
module.

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        # ...
        'path.to.layout.example',
        'path.to.plugin.sample_memo',
        # ...
    )

After it's done, go to terminal and type the following command.

.. code-block:: sh

    ./manage.py dash_sync_plugins

If your HTTP server is running, you would then be able to access your dashboard.

- View URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard/
- Edit URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard/edit/

Note, that you have to be logged in, in order to use the dashboard. If your new
plugin doesn't appear, set the ``DASH_DEBUG`` to True in your Django's local
settings module (`local_settings.py`), re-run your code and check console for
error notifications.

Plugin and widget factory
=========================
In general, when making a new plugin, base widgets are made for then too. By
creating base widgets you avoid duplication of the code. See the example below.

.. code-block:: python

    from dash.base import BaseDashboardPlugin

    class BaseMemoPlugin(BaseDashboardPlugin):

        name = _("Memo")
        group = _("Memo")
        form = MemoForm

Now that we have the base plugin, we can use plugin factory to generate and
register plugin classes of the required dimensions.

.. code-block:: python

    from dash.factory import plugin_factory
    plugin_factory(BaseMemoPlugin, 'memo', ((5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6)))

The code above will generate "memo_5x6", "memo_6x5" and "memo_6x6" plugin
classes which subclass the ``BaseMemoPlugin`` and register them in the plugin
registry. The ``uid`` property would be automatically generated.

Same goes for the widgets.

.. code-block:: python

    from dash.base import BaseDashboardPluginWidget

    class BaseMemoWidget(BaseDashboardPluginWidget):

        def render(self, request=None):
            context = {'plugin': self.plugin}
            return render_to_string('memo/render.html', context)

Now that we have the base widget, we can use plugin widget factory to generate
and register plugin widget classes of the required dimensions.

.. code-block:: python

    from dash.factory import plugin_widget_factory

    plugin_widget_factory(
        BaseMemoWidget,
        'bootstrap2_fluid',
        'main',
        'memo',
        ((5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6))
    )

The code above will generate "memo_5x6", "memo_6x5" and "memo_6x6" plugin
widget classes which subclass the ``BaseMemoWidget`` and register them in the
plugin widget registry. The ``layout_uid``, ``placeholder_uid``,
``plugin_uid``, ``cols`` and ``rows`` properties would be automatically
generated.

Of course, there would be cases when you can't use factory, for example because
each of your plugins or widgets differs from others by tiny important bits, but
if you notice yourself subclassing the base widget or plugin many times without
any change to the code, then it's perhaps a right time to start using the
factory.

Layout, plugin and widget summary
=================================
When making your own layouts, plugins and plugin widgets you are free to use
the API as you wish. While developing the Dash, I found the follow practices
useful:

- When making a new plugin, always make a base plugin class, from which all 
  size specific ones would derive.
- Do create base plugin widgets (with HTML templates) in the plugin, but do not 
  register them there. Use factory (``dash.factory``) to generate and register
  layout specific plugin widgets - preferably in the layout module.
- If you're adding custom plugin to existing bundled layout (those that 
  reside in ``dash.contrib.layouts``), create a new module named
  ``dash_custom`` (or any other name that you prefer) and factory
  generate/register your layout specific plugin widgets in a module named
  ``dash_plugins.py`` (do not forget to add the module to ``INSTALLED_APPS``,
  so that it auto-discovered).

Permissions
===========
Plugin system allows administrators to specify the access rights to every 
plugin. Dash permissions are based on Django Users and User Groups. Access
rights are manageable via Django admin (/administration/dash/dashboardplugin/).
Note, that your admin URL prefix may vary from the one given in example (it's
usually "/admin/", while in example it's "/administration/"). If user doesn't
have the rights to access plugin, it doesn't appear on his dashboard even if
has been added to it (imagine, you have once granted the right to use the news
plugin to all users, but later on decided to limit it to Staff members group
only). Note, that superusers have access to all plugins.

Management commands
===================
There are several management commands.

- ``dash_find_broken_dashboard_entries``. Find broken dashboard entries that
  occur when some plugin which did exist in the system, no longer exists.
- ``dash_sync_plugins``. Should be ran each time a new plugin is being added
  to the Dash.
- ``dash_update_plugin_data``. A mechanism to update existing plugin data in
  case if it had become invalid after a change in a plugin. In order for it
  to work, each plugin should implement and ``update`` method, in which the
  data update happens.

Tuning
======
There are number of Dash settings you can override in the `settings.py` module
of your Django project:

- ``DASH_RESTRICT_PLUGIN_ACCESS`` (bool): If set to True, (Django) permission
  system for dash plugins is enabled. Defaults to True. Setting this to False
  makes all plugins available for all users.
- ``DASH_ACTIVE_LAYOUT`` (str): Active (default) layout UID. Defaults to
  "android".
- ``DASH_LAYOUT_CELL_UNITS`` (str): Allowed values for layout cell units.
  Defaults to ("em", "px", "pt", "%").
- ``DASH_DISPLAY_AUTH_LINK`` (bool): If set to True, the log out link is shown
  in the Dash drop-down menu. Defaults to True.

For tuning of specific contrib plugin, see the docs in the plugin directory.

Styling tips
============
Font Awesome is used for icons. As a convention, all icons of font-awesome are
placed within a span. Next to their original class, they all should be getting
an extra class "iconic". Follow that rule when making a new layout or a
plugin (HTML). It allows to make the styling easy, since icon colours could be
then changed within no time.

Bundled plugins and layouts
===========================
Dash ships with number of bundled (demo) plugins and layouts that are mainly
made to demonstrate its' abilities. In order to work among various layouts
(themes), each plugin has a single widget registered for a single layout.
It's possible to unregister a bundled widget and replace it with a custom one.

Bundled plugins
---------------
Below a short overview of the plugins. See the README.rst file in directory
of each plugin for details.

- `Dummy plugin
  <https://github.com/barseghyanartur/django-dash/tree/stable/src/dash/contrib/plugins/dummy>`_.
  Mainly made for quick testing. Still, is perfect example of how to write a
  plugin and widgets.
- `Image plugin
  <https://github.com/barseghyanartur/django-dash/tree/stable/src/dash/contrib/plugins/image>`_.
  Allows users to put images on their dashboard. If you plan to make a plugin
  that deals with file uploads, make sure to check the source of this one
  first.
- `Memo plugin
  <https://github.com/barseghyanartur/django-dash/tree/stable/src/dash/contrib/plugins/memo>`_.
  Allows users to put short notes on their dashboard.
- `RSS feed plugin
  <https://github.com/barseghyanartur/django-dash/tree/stable/src/dash/contrib/plugins/rss_feed>`_.
  Allows users to put any RSS feed right into the dashboard.
- `URL plugin
  <https://github.com/barseghyanartur/django-dash/tree/stable/src/dash/contrib/plugins/url>`_.
  Allows users to put links to their dashboard.
- `Bookmark plugin
  <https://github.com/barseghyanartur/django-dash/tree/stable/src/dash/contrib/plugins/url>`_.
  Allows users to put bookmarks to their dashboard. Bookmarks are added by
  the administrator.
- `Video plugin
  <https://github.com/barseghyanartur/django-dash/tree/stable/src/dash/contrib/plugins/video>`_.
  Allows users to put YouTube or Vimeo videos to their dashboard.

  Allows to put a weather widget into dashboard.

Demo plugins
------------
- `Sample D3 plugins
  <https://github.com/barseghyanartur/django-dash/tree/master/examples/example/d3_samples>`_.
  Shows how to transform D3.js charts into Dash plugins.
- `Sample Polychart2 plugin
  <https://github.com/barseghyanartur/django-dash/tree/master/examples/example/bar>`_.
  Shows how to transform Polychart2.js charts into Dash plugins.
- `News plugin
  <https://github.com/barseghyanartur/django-dash/tree/stable/examples/example/news>`_.
  Shows how to embed your Django news application (front-end part of it) into
  a Dash plugin widget.

Bundled layouts
---------------
Below a short overview of the layouts. See the README.rst file in directory
of each layout for details.

- `Android 
  <https://github.com/barseghyanartur/django-dash/tree/stable/src/dash/contrib/layouts/android>`_
  (like) layout. Has two placeholders: main (6 cols x 5 rows, each block sized
  150x110 px) and shortcuts (1 col x 10 rows, each block sized 60x55 px).
- `Bootstrap 2 fluid 
  <https://github.com/barseghyanartur/django-dash/tree/stable/src/dash/contrib/layouts/bootstrap2>`_
  (like) layout. Has one placeholder: main (11 cols x 9 rows, each block sized
  70x40 px).
- `Windows 8 
  <https://github.com/barseghyanartur/django-dash/tree/stable/src/dash/contrib/layouts/windows8>`_
  (like) layout. Has two placeholders: main (6 cols x 4 rows, each block sized
  140x135 px) and sidebar (2 cols x 4 rows, each block sized 140x135 px).

Demo layouts
------------
- `Example
  <https://github.com/barseghyanartur/django-dash/tree/stable/examples/example/foo>`_
  layout. Has five placeholders: top (8 cols x 1 rows, each block sized
  55x55 px), right (3 col x 8 rows, each block sized 55x55 px), bottom (
  8 cols x 1 rows, each block sized 55x55 px), left (3 col x 8 rows, each
  block sized 55x55 px) and main (5 col x 4 rows, each block sized 110x95 px).

Naming conventions
==================
Although you are free to name your plugins and widgets as you want (except that
you should comply with `PEP-008
<http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-names>`_), there are some
naming conventions introduced, that you are recommended to follow.

- Example1x1Plugin: 1x1 example plugin
    - Example1x1AndroidMainWidget: 1x1 widget for 1x1 example plugin (layout
      Android, placeholder 'main')
    - Example1x1AndroidShortcutsWidget: 1x1 widget for 1x1 example plugin (
      layout Android, placeholder 'shortcuts')
    - Example1x1Windows8MainWidget: 1x1 widget for 1x1 example plugin (layout
      Windows 8, placeholder 'main')
    - Example1x1Windows8SidebarWidget: 1x1 widget for 1x1 example plugin (
      layout Windows 8, placeholder 'sidebar')

- Example2x3Plugin: 2x3 example plugin
    - Example2x3Windows8MainWidget: 2x3 widget for 2x3 example plugin (layout
      Windows 8, placeholder 'main')
    - Example2x3Windows8SidebarWidget: 2x3 widget for 2x3 example plugin (
      layout Windows 8, placeholder 'sidebar')

- Example6x1Plugin: 6x1 example plugin
    - Example6x1YourLayoutSidebarWidget: 6x1 widget for 6x1 example plugin (
      layout Your Layout, placeholder 'main')

Debugging
=========
Most of the errors are logged (DEBUG). If you have written a plugin and it
somehow doesn't appear in the list of available plugins, do run the following
management command:

.. code-block:: sh

    ./manage.py dash_sync_plugins

The ``dash_sync_plugins`` not only syncs your plugins into the database, but
also is a great way of checking for possible errors.

Available translations
======================
- Dutch (core and plugins)
- Russian (core and plugins)

Troubleshooting
===============
- If you somehow get problems installing ``Dash``, check the `example
  <https://github.com/barseghyanartur/django-dash/tree/master/examples>`__
  project and the `requirements.txt
  <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/barseghyanartur/django-dash/master/examples/requirements/latest.txt>`__.

Testing
=======
Project is covered by test (functional- and browser-tests).

Py.test is used as a default test runner.

To test with all supported Python/Django versions type:

.. code-block:: sh

    tox

To test against specific environment, type:

.. code-block:: sh

    tox -e py35-django18

To test just your working environment type:

.. code-block:: sh

    ./runtests.py

To tests just your working environment (with Django test runner) type:

.. code-block:: sh

    ./manage.py test dash

It's assumed that you have all the requirements installed. If not, first
install the test requirements:

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install -r examples/requirements/test.txt

Browser tests
-------------
For browser tests you may choose between Firefox, headless Firefox and
PhantomJS. PhantomJS is faster, headless Firefox is fast as well, but
normal Firefox tests tell you more (as you see what exactly happens on the
screen). Both cases require some effort and both have disadvantages regarding
the installation (although once you have them installed they work perfect).

Latest versions of Firefox are often not supported by Selenium. Current
version of the Selenium for Python (2.53.6) works fine with Firefox 47.
Thus, instead of using system Firefox you could better use a custom one.

For PhantomJS you need to have NodeJS installed.

Set up Firefox 47
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Download Firefox 47 from
   `this
   <https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/47.0.1/linux-x86_64/en-GB/firefox-47.0.1.tar.bz2>`__
   location and unzip it into ``/usr/lib/firefox47/``

2. Specify the full path to your Firefox in ``FIREFOX_BIN_PATH``
   setting. Example:

   .. code-block:: python

       FIREFOX_BIN_PATH = '/usr/lib/firefox47/firefox'

   If you set ``FIREFOX_BIN_PATH`` to None, system Firefox would be used.

After that your Selenium tests would work.

Set up headless Firefox
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Install ``xvfb`` package which is used to start Firefox in headless mode.

   .. code-block:: sh

        sudo apt-get install xvfb

2. Run the tests using headless Firefox.

   .. code-block:: sh

        ./scripts/runtests.sh

   Or run tox tests using headless Firefox.

   .. code-block:: sh

        ./scripts/tox.sh

Setup PhantomJS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You could also run tests in headless mode (faster). For that you will need
PhantomJS.

1. Install PhantomJS and dependencies.

   .. code-block:: sh

       curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
       sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
       sudo apt-get install nodejs
       sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev
       sudo npm -g install phantomjs-prebuilt

2. Specify the ``PHANTOM_JS_EXECUTABLE_PATH`` setting. Example:

   .. code-block:: python

       PHANTOM_JS_EXECUTABLE_PATH = ""

   If you want to use Firefox for testing, set
   ``PHANTOM_JS_EXECUTABLE_PATH`` to None.
